## Parsing JSON

Parsing JSON data in JavaScript involves converting a JSON string into a JavaScript object. This allows you to access and manipulate the data in a structured way. JavaScript provides built-in methods, such as `JSON.parse()`, to parse JSON data as well as `JSON.stringify()` to convert a JavaScript object into a JSON string.

## Example Code

Here's an example of how to parse JSON data using JavaScript:
